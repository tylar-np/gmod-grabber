# Grabber
Grabber is a tool for Garry's Mod servers that allows clients to "clone" entire GitHub repos to their data folder
It supports writing files based on GitHub username and repository name, and saving the repo to any arbitrary folder in `data/`.

Users can download specific release tags or branch names, and it will keep track of the last target downloaded.

It runs entirely on the client, there is no serverside code.

## Installing
Place `addons/grabber` into your `garrysmod/addons/` folder.

## Using
Type `grabber help` in the game console for help. 

Just type `grabber` to use a GUI instead of a CLI.

Typing `!grabber` in game chat will pull up the GUI as well.
